            Ernakulam bordering the district of Thrissur in the north, Idukki in the East, Alappuzha and Kottayam in the south, Lakshadweep Sea in the west is an amalgam of a hoary heritage and global growth of industry and commerce. For the outside world, Ernakulam is part of Kochi referred to in the history of Kerala as the Queen of Arabian Sea. The densely populated Ernakulam District embodies the achievements of the Kerala State in literacy, industry, trade, and commerce. With an inclusive culture, relatively high per capita income and an unstoppable interest of the people in updating themselves of the political, economic, social and cultural happenings in the national and international spheres, Ernakulamrepresents the high modern phase of the Kerala society.Ernakulam District came into being in 1958 April 1 by incorporating Kanayannoor, Kochi, Kunnathunadu, Aluva and Paroor Taluks. Deliberation for hours held at the Kerala Fine Arts Hall in 1957 and attended by a host of political, social and media activists was instrumental in the formation of the District.

            The etymology of the term ‘Ernakulam’ is linked to different sources, either temple-oriented or mythological. KomattilAchutha Menon attributes the origin of the word from a type of mud called ‘Erangiyal’. Lord Siva was addressed in Chennai as ‘Erayanar’in the past. In Kerala too, this was followed and it later came to be known as ‘Ernakulam’. Ebanubathootha who travelled along the Kerala coast between AD 1342 and AD 1347 did not even make a casual reference to Kochi. The name ‘Kochi’ is a combination of two terms, Koch&Azhi (small river-mouth).
