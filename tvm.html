            Thiruvananthapuram also known as Trivandrum, is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Kerala. The city has a population of 957,730 inhabitants and a metropolitan population of 1.68 million. Thiruvananthapuram is a major Information Technology hub in India, and contributes 55% of Kerala’s software exports as of 2015.Thiruvananthapuram is located on the west coast of India near the extreme south of the mainland. Referred by Mahatma Gandhi as the “Evergreen city of India”,the city is characterised by its undulating terrain of low coastal hills.The city is classified as a Tier-II city by the government of India.Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for the Indian sub-continent, must surely have been a “must see” destination for ages, long before National Geographic Traveller classified it as one. Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam to wrest Kerala, God’s own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the times of Mahabali the democratic and justruler of this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit. It doesnt take any flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of intrepid travellers and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo, Fa Hien, and quite possibly, countless others from the pages of history, recorded or not.
